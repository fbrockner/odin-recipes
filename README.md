# odin-recipes
A recipe website that implements the foundations of website development that were learned from the Odin Project. 

This project is to put all of the fundamental HTML skills that I learned while doing the Odin Project into practice. I will be building a website that has a homepage that links to three recipe pages. I will be linking html files and saved images, utilizing body, header, and paragraph elements to display the recipes and images, creating ordered and unordered lists of the ingredients and steps for each recipe, and learning how to create effective git commit messages.
