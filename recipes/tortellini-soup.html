            <li>6 cups baby spinach</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>
            <li>1 cup shaved Parmesan cheese (about 4 ounces)</li>
            <li>1 loaf French bread, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté, 
                stirring constantly, until the onion is soft and tender, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, tomatoes, and Italian seasoning and bring to a rolling boil. 
                Add the tortellini and beans and cook until the tortellini are cooked through, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the spinach, parsley, basil, and salt and pepper to taste 
                and stir until the spinach is just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Squeeze the lemon juice over the soup.</li>
            <li>Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with the Parmesan, and serve immediately with torn bread for dipping.</li>
            <li>Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months. 
                Let the soup thaw before reheating.</li>
        </ol>
